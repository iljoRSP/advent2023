my disgusting code for advent of code 2023
<br><br><br>

some comments:
 - tl;dr i can't be bothered to optimise unless i suddenly feel like it
 - ill use regex when i feel like getting annoyed by regex specifically
 - im using python because its easy and comfortable
 - where i can get away with it, i won't use any insane data structures because i can't be bothered
   - not to mention any data structure i come up with will probably be terrible anyway
